{Symmetry-based Graph fourier transforms: are they optimal for image compression?


BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
--------------------
Traditional block-based transforms are based on applying a single transform to all blocks.~As an alternative,
better performance in image and video processing and representation can be achieved by choosing one among a discrete set of transforms for each block.
As an example, our recently proposed set of multiple transforms called Symmetry-Based Graph Fourier Transforms (SBGFTs) have shown good performance in terms of energy compaction,
improving HEVC intra coding performance when used to replace the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
This paper further explores the performance of the SBGFTs in a multiple transforms, non-linear approximation perspective,
by comparing them with two alternative sets of orthogonal transforms, namely, the Karhunen-Lo√®ve Transform (KLT) and the Sparse Orthonormal Transform (SOT).
Experimental results confirm that SBGFTs achieve superior representation ability in this context as well,
suggesting that they could assume a central role in image compression.


USAGE
--------------------
Folders
--------------------
Folders Centroids and CentroidsHD collect the files .mat containing the centroids associated to the clusters calculated on the SD and HD datasets, respectively. 

The SD and HD clusters are located in the folders Clusters and ClustersHD, while their corresponding covariance matrices are in CovMat and CovMatHD.

Folder In includes the eigenvectors of the SBGFTs, KLTs and SOTs in their corresponding files .mat.

Note that the KLTs can be re-generated running the script generateKLT.m (see below), as well as the SOTs finding the code in the folder generateSOT.

Files
--------------------
main_exp.m performs the comparison between SBGFTs, KLTs and SOTs.

main_exp_xx.m calculates the performance of the SBGFTs set with cardinality xx.

main_exp_cardinality_reduction.m calculates the histogram of the SBGFTs. The resulting graph indices rank can be found in Indices.mat.

generateKLT.m generates the KLTs associated to the covariance matrices.

The clustering process is performed in Python by the function sklearn.cluster.KMeans().
